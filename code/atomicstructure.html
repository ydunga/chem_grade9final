            <p> Below you will find the schematic atomic structure of some of the elements belonging to Group 0 and Group 1 in the periodic table. </p>
            <p> What you see in the center of each element is the <u>nucelus</u> of the atom and surrounding it are <u>electrons</u> which move around the nucelus in fixed orbits known as <u>shells</u>. </p>

          <p>We know now that this is what the structure of an atom is. However, the discovery of these subatomic particles took a very long time.</p>
          <p>One of the first scientists to put forth a theory of atoms was John Dalton.</p>
          <p>According to Dalton, atoms were indivisible particles, which could neither be destroyed, nor created in a chemical reaction.</p>
          <p>Atoms of a given element were identical in mass and chemical properties and they combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to form <u>compounds</u></p>
          <p>The law that atoms can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical process is known as the <u>law of conservation of mass.</u></p>
          <p>And the law that within a chemical compounds, elements are always found in definite proportions is known as <u>law of constant proportions.</u></p>
