            <p> When an atom loses or gains an electron, it acquires a charge. A charged atoms is known as an <b>ion. </b></p>
            <p> You know that within an atom, the number of protons = number of electrons. So the overall charge of the atom is neutral. However when an atom losses or gains an electron in it's outermost shell the charge of the atom can change.</p>
          <p> A positively charged ion is called an <u>anion</u> and a negatively charged ion is called a <u>cation.</u></p>

          <p> Metallic elements often lose electrons and become positively charged. <p>
            <p> While non-metallic elements will gain an electron and become negatively charged. </p> 
            <p> The opposite charge between the two ions then leads to a strong electrostatic force of attraction- which forms an ionic bond between them. </p>
            <p> Elements within the same group in the periodic table have the same valency.</p>

            <p>To get the result of two elements bonding to form compounds, you can use the cross method below.</p>
            <p>If it is an ionic bond then one of the elements will gain electrons, while the other will lose electrons.</p>
            <p>If it is a covalent bond then the two elements will share electrons so as to achieve a full octet in their outermost shell.</p>
            <p>When a compound is made of a metal and non-metal, the name of the metal is written first.</p>
            <p> In this first example we have hydrogen and chlorine. The valency of hydrogen is 1+ and the valency of Chlorine is 1-. </p>
            <p>This will be a covalent bond and hydrogen and chlorine will share an electron so that both elements have a full outershell.</p>

              <p> In the formula for calcium hydroxide we have brackets around (OH)<sub>2</sub>. Brackets are used when you have two or more of the same ions in the formula. This means in calcium hyrdoxide there are two atoms each of oxygen and hydrogen in Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>.</p>
